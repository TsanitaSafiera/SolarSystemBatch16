How to create a branch?if u need to work on an existing project

2.before even starting to work on the project , create a branch
      --git branch branchName
      --git checkout branchName

write ur code
commit it on the same branch
push it to the remote (git push -u origin branchName)


review and merge
click on the pullreuqest tab
Open a new Pull request
select base --> main  compare--> branch_u_want_to_merge
put in message
create pull request



as being team lead if u want to review the code and merge it:

1.clone
2.by default the branch is only going to be main, so u do
            --git branch -a --> to list all the available branches
            --git checkout branchName--> downalod the branch that u want to

review the code
4.merge---> git checkout main (siwtch to the branch u want to merge)
            git merge branchName (the branch which u wan to merge)

update remote --> git push



how as being a team memeber after having the merged main, get ur local main updated too?

switch to main branch on ur local
git fetch
git pull
